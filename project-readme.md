# The Enchanted Forest Adventure ðŸŒ²âœ¨

## Project Overview
The Enchanted Forest Adventure is an interactive text-based adventure game where players navigate through a magical forest, making choices that shape their unique story path. The game features:

- **Interactive storytelling** with player choices affecting the narrative
- **Multiple story paths** leading to different game endings
- **Inventory system** that tracks collected items
- **Conditional story branches** based on previous choices and collected items
- **Three different endings** depending on player decisions
- **Text animation** for immersive storytelling

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed
2. Download all project files to a local directory
3. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project directory
4. Run the main script:
   ```
   python enchanted_forest.py
   ```
   
Or alternatively:
   ```
   python demo_script.py
   ```

## Game Features

### Player Choices
Throughout the adventure, players will face decisions that change the course of their journey. Each choice leads to different locations, encounters, and potentially different items to collect.

### Item Collection
Players can collect various magical items:
- Forest Tongue: Ability to understand forest creatures
- Crystal Wand: A magical tool with special powers
- Guardian Knowledge: Secret knowledge about the forest
- Guardian Blessing: Special protection from the forest guardian

### Multiple Endings
Depending on the paths taken and items collected, players can achieve three different endings:
1. **Guardian of the Forest**: The highest honor (requires Guardian Blessing)
2. **Forest Mage**: Mastery of forest magic (requires both Crystal Wand and Forest Tongue)
3. **Forest Explorer**: Basic completion of the adventure

### Game Mechanics
- Progress tracking for locations visited
- Record of all choices made during gameplay
- Dynamic storytelling based on player inventory
- Type-writer text effect for immersive reading experience

## Project Structure
- `enchanted_forest.py` - Main game with the InteractiveStory class
- `demo_script.py` - Script for demonstrating the game during presentations
- `story_map.png` - Visual map of the story paths (for presentation purposes)
- `README.md` - This documentation file

## Presentation Tips
When presenting this project:
1. Use the demo script to showcase key features without playing the entire game
2. Highlight the branching narrative structure using the story map
3. Demonstrate how different choices lead to different outcomes
4. Show how the inventory system affects available options
5. Explain the code structure and how it manages game state

## Future Enhancement Ideas
- Add background music and sound effects
- Implement a graphical user interface
- Add more story branches and locations
- Include combat mechanics using the health attribute
- Create a save/load system for game progress
- Add more items and their unique effects on gameplay

## Credits
This interactive story engine was designed and developed as a demonstration of text-based adventure game mechanics using object-oriented programming in Python.
